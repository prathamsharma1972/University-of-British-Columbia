                <p>Education is both the act of teaching knowledge to others and the act of receiving knowledge from
                    someone else. Education also refers to the knowledge received through schooling or instruction and
                    to the institution of teaching as a whole. Education has a few other senses as a noun.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Education is a word that covers both the act of instructing and the act of learning. It usually
                    refers specifically to the teaching of children or younger people and the learning done by them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society.
                    In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or enculturation.
                    Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or the middle
                    classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is designed to guide them in learning a
                    culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual
                    role in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often little formal learning—little of
                    what one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead, the entire environment and
                    all activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all adults act as teachers.
                    As societies grow more complex, however, the quantity of knowledge to be passed on from one
                    generation to the next becomes more than any one person can know, and, hence, there must evolve more
                    selective and efficient means of cultural transmission. The outcome is formal education—the school
                    and the specialist called the teacher. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Education, discipline that is concerned with methods of teaching and learning in schools or
                    school-like environments as opposed to various nonformal and informal means of socialization (e.g.,
                    rural development projects and education through parent-child relationships).</p>
